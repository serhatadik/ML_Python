# Introduction to Python and Machine Learning
This repository stores scripts I used in a tutorial series I gave at a company.

### Gaussian Naive Bayes: 
Explaining briefly the math behind Naive Bayes classification and a plant classification example using Gaussian distribution.

### K Nearest Neighbor: 
Visualizing the idea behind KNN and giving a hands-on example using banking data.

### Logistic Regression: 
Explaining briefly the math behind logistic regression and giving a hands-on example using banking data.

### Multiple Linear Regression and Regularization: 
Explaining the math behind linear regression and multiple linear regression, giving an example using stock market data. Explaining regularization and illustrating Ridge and Lasso regularizations' effect on regression.

### Artificial Neural Networks:
Explaining the architecture and potential loss functions used in neural network training and training a simple ANN model for plant classification using PyTorch.
